# /docs/

`docs` is a folder that currently contains what can be considered random thoughts
as to how to explain the code I am making but also trying to chart how i will
attempt to standardize the code without making too verbose code.

;)

## command line standards

## data structure standards

## composability interfaces

## efficient functions
