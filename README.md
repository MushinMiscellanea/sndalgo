## `xenakis`

our xenakis sieve package. this will be extremely integrated into
this system.

### reasoning

1. xenakis sieves extend a form of set theory that is constructable
and manipulable with logical operations (i.e. `AND`, `OR`).
2. sieves have a dual ability to operate as both _CV_ and _signal_
parameters, depending on how they are used.
