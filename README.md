# `sndalgo`<span>&ndash;</span>signal / number stuff for creative use

## `xenakis`

our xenakis sieve package. this will be extremely integrated into
this system.

### reasoning

1. xenakis sieves extend a form of set theory that is constructable
and manipulable with logical operations (i.e. `AND`, `OR`).
2. sieves have a dual ability to operate as both _CV_ and _signal_
parameters, depending on how they are used.
3. applications like step sequencers, theory guides, and
sidechainers are all summated within a single body of knowledge.
4. algorithmic composition.
5. synthesis, analysis, and architecture of composition with
scales, chords, progressions, order, and any other hand in building
sonic phenomena.
6. modular design, dimensionless, unitless.

## `pitch`

_<span style="color:red;">planning</span>_

this can convert pitches to frequencies, integers to pitches;
anything that needs conversion, normalization, etc. should be found
here.

### uses

1. conversion between different units with time-domain
2. analyzing, creating, and applying scales
3. transforming numbers into time-domain values

## `midi`

_<span style="color:red;">planning</span>_

this should have both real-time and hard-bodied MIDI utilities.

### uses

1. forming `.mid` files from inputs
2. reading `.mid` files and exposing an API for them
3. analyzing MIDI
4. streaming (duplex) MIDI (hopefully) without dependencies
