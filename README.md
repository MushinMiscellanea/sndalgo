## `xenakis`

our xenakis sieve package. this will be extremely integrated into
this system.

### reasoning

1. xenakis sieves extend a form of set theory that is constructable
and manipulable with logical operations (i.e. `AND`, `OR`).
2. sieves have a dual ability to operate as both _CV_ and _signal_
parameters, depending on how they are used.
3. applications like step sequencers, theory guides, and
sidechainers are all summated within a single body of knowledge.
4. algorithmic composition.
5. synthesis, analysis, and architecture of composition with
scales, chords, progressions, order, and any other hand in building
sonic phenomena.
6. modular design, dimensionless, unitless.
